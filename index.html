<p>To Whom it May Concern:</p>

<p>
I am writing to apply for the Paid Internship position in Finance at P&G headquarters in Geneva.
I am currently in my sophomore year at in the top-ranked business program at Babson College,
where I am serving as a teaching assistant in a Business Analytics course, while taking business
administration courses to build on my internship in the legal department at CERN in Geneva in 2019.
I am looking for a position where I can expand my business credentials while making a unique contribution
through  my analytics, reporting, and problem solving skills.
</p>
<p>
Over the past three years, I have worked closely with teams in a wide range of settings, from the
Business Analytics classroom, where I am responsible for explaining concepts and methods, while
developing and grading assignments, for 30 students, to the legal department of CERN, where I transited
through legal specialties ranging from contracts and international law to employee health and safety to
internal complaint resolution.  In each department, I learned the requirements, and performed project
work such as drafting mock agreements, or documenting arguments and proposing resolution to employee
complaints. </p>
<p>
I have also served as a reliable and high-energy bartender at the Orient Hotel, a landmark pub in Sydney,
Australia, where I collaborated with four other bartenders to provide consistently high-quality service
during the Vivid Festival, which brings more than two million tourists from around the world.  Similarly,
I have collaborated with three TAs in the Business Analytics course, to problem solve student assignments,
grading, and inquiries, and I have also helped foster a teamwork-driven culture as a waiter and camp aide
at Camp Pemigewassett in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>
In every role, I have served as a mission-driven consensus-builder, with analytical and conversation skills
to identify issues and build agreement around resolutions. I believe my combination of analytical and creative
problem solving, as well as my international background and my experience fostering a culture of competitive
teamwork that improves everyone’s performance, will make me an asset to your finance internship program.
I have attached my resume, and look forward to speaking with you about the position you are looking to fill.
</p>
Kind Regards,
<br>

<p>Luca Tschanz</p>
