<h3>Cover Letter</h3>
<p>I am writing to apply for the Paid Internship position in Finance at P&G headquarters in Geneva.
I am currently in my sophomore year at Babson College, where I am serving as a teaching
assistant in a Business Analytics course, while taking business administration courses to build on
my internship in the legal department at CERN in Geneva in 2019. I am d looking for a position
where I can expand my business credentials while making a unique contribution through my
analytics, reporting, and problem solving skills.</p>
<p>
Over the past three years, I have worked closely with teams in a wide range of settings, from the
Business Analytics classroom, where I am responsible for explaining concepts and methods,
while developing and grading assignments, for 30 students, to the legal department of CERN,
where I transited through legal specialties ranging from international contracts and international
law to employee health and safety to internal complaint resolution. In each department, I learned
the requirements, and performed project work such as drafting mock agreements, or
documenting arguments and proposing resolution to employee complaints.</p>
<p>
I have also served as a reliable and high-energy bartender, collaborating with four other
bartenders to provide consistently high-quality service at the Orient Hotel, a landmark pub in
Sydney, Australia, during the Vivid Festival, which brings more than two million tourists from
around the world. Similarly, I have collaborated with three TAs in the Business Analytics
course, to problem solve student assignments, grading, and inquiries, and I have also helped
foster a teamwork-driven culture as a waiter and camp aide at Camp Pemigewassett in New
Hampshire.</p>
<p>
In every role, I have served as a mission-driven consensus-builder, with analytical and
conversation skills to identify issues and build agreement around resolutions.
I believe my combination of analytical and creative problem solving, as well as my international
background and my experience fostering a culture of competitive teamwork that improves
everyone’s performance, will make me an asset to your finance internship program.

looking to fill.
